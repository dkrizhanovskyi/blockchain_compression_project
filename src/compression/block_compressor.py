Module: BlockCompressor
Purpose:
    The `BlockCompressor` module is responsible for the efficient compression and decompression 
    of raw blockchain block data using the LZMA algorithm. This module is critical for reducing 
    the overall size of blockchain data stored on nodes, thereby optimizing storage space without 
    compromising data integrity.

    The use of the LZMA algorithm ensures high compression ratios, while maintaining relatively fast 
    decompression times. This is particularly useful for blockchain environments where nodes need 
    to store and retrieve large amounts of data.

    Key Features:
    - Compresses blockchain block data to minimize storage requirements.
    - Decompresses data with full fidelity, ensuring that the original block data can be restored 
      without loss.

    Cryptographic Considerations:
    Although LZMA is not a cryptographic algorithm, the integrity of the compressed data is paramount 
    in blockchain systems. The BlockCompressor module should be used in combination with cryptographic 
    hashes or digital signatures to ensure data integrity and security during compression and decompression.

class BlockCompressor:
    """
    BlockCompressor class to handle compression and decompression
    of blockchain block data using LZMA algorithm.

    Security Note:
    The LZMA algorithm provides efficient compression but does not provide cryptographic security.
    It is important to ensure that any compressed data is cryptographically hashed or signed 
    before being stored or transmitted to preserve its integrity.

    def compress_block(self, block_data: bytes) -> bytes:
        """
        Compresses the raw block data using LZMA algorithm.

        :param block_data: Raw block data as bytes.
                          This is the original blockchain block that needs to be compressed. 
                          Typically, this would include transaction data, headers, and metadata.

                 The compressed version of the blockchain block, which significantly reduces 
                 the amount of space required for storage.
        
        Performance Consideration:
        LZMA is highly efficient for larger datasets, such as blockchain blocks, 
        which often contain large amounts of repeated or structured data. The compression 
        algorithm reduces the block size without compromising the ability to fully reconstruct 
        the original data.

        :return: Decompressed block data.
                 The original block data is restored to its full size, ensuring that no information is lost 
                 during the compression-decompression process.
        
        Data Integrity:
        Although the LZMA algorithm ensures lossless decompression, it is important to pair this process 
        with integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic hash verification) to ensure that the decompressed data 
        has not been tampered with or corrupted.

Security and Architecture Notes:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   The `BlockCompressor` class adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by strictly handling
   the compression and decompression of blockchain data. It does not perform any cryptographic integrity 
   checks, which should be handled by other components in the blockchain system (e.g., digital signatures
   or hash verification).

2. **Scalability**:
   By using the LZMA algorithm, which is designed for high compression ratios, this module can efficiently 
   handle the growing size of blockchain blocks as the number of transactions increases. This ensures that 
   the system remains scalable without excessive storage overhead.

3. **Cryptographic Integrity**:
   While the LZMA algorithm ensures lossless compression, it does not provide built-in cryptographic security.
   Therefore, this module should be integrated with secure cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., SHA-256 hashing 
   or digital signatures) to guarantee the authenticity and integrity of the compressed and decompressed data.
