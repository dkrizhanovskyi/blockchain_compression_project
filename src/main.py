Module: Main Blockchain Data Management Program
Purpose:
    The `main.py` module serves as the entry point for demonstrating the key functionalities 
    of various components in the blockchain data compression and management system. This program 
    highlights the integration of multiple modules, including:
    
    - Block compression and decompression to optimize storage efficiency.
    - State delta storage for tracking blockchain state changes efficiently.
    - Merkle tree construction for transaction verification and data integrity.
    - Blockchain pruning to manage long-term storage by removing outdated blocks.
    - Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARKs) for privacy-preserving verification of blockchain data.

    The goal of this program is to simulate the interaction between different modules in a 
    blockchain system and demonstrate how compression, pruning, and cryptographic verification 
    can be effectively implemented in a blockchain environment.

Cryptographic Considerations:
    Each feature, especially the ZK-SNARK and Merkle tree modules, involves cryptographic processes 
    that ensure data integrity and security. These components are crucial in maintaining the security 
    guarantees of the blockchain without compromising on performance or privacy.

Security and Architectural Considerations:

1. **Integration of Cryptographic Techniques**:
   This main module demonstrates the integration of key cryptographic components, such as Merkle trees 
   and ZK-SNARKs, which ensure data integrity and privacy. The use of a Merkle tree provides an efficient 
   way to verify transactions, while ZK-SNARKs enhance the privacy of blockchain data by allowing proof-based 
   verification without revealing the underlying details.

2. **Data Efficiency**:
   The block compression and state delta modules highlight storage optimization techniques crucial for 
   blockchain scalability. By compressing blockchain data and managing state changes efficiently, 
   the system reduces storage costs while maintaining the integrity of the data.

3. **Scalability and Maintenance**:
   Blockchain pruning ensures that the system remains scalable over time by discarding outdated blocks 
   and keeping storage use manageable. This functionality is essential for long-running blockchain systems 
   to prevent excessive data buildup.

4. **Future Expansion**:
   This main script provides a clear structure for extending the system to include additional cryptographic 
   mechanisms, more complex state management, and other blockchain functionalities, making it a solid foundation 
   for more advanced blockchain solutions.
