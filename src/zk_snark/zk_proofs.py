Module: ZKSnark
Purpose:
    The `ZKSnark` module is a placeholder for implementing Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments 
    of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs), which are advanced cryptographic protocols that allow one party to prove 
    to another that a statement is true, without revealing any additional information beyond the veracity 
    of the statement itself.

    In the context of blockchain, ZK-SNARKs can be used to prove that a transaction is valid without revealing 
    the transaction details (e.g., amounts or parties involved). This enhances both privacy and scalability 
    in blockchain systems.

    Key Features:
    - Placeholder for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs.
    - Simple demonstration with a mock proof system (not an actual ZK-SNARK implementation).
    - Cryptographic hash-based proof generation for data integrity.

    Cryptographic Considerations:
    This module provides a conceptual framework for ZK-SNARKs but does not implement the actual cryptographic 
    algorithms. In a real-world system, ZK-SNARKs require complex cryptographic setup and trusted keys to 
    generate and verify proofs securely. It is critical that the implementation of ZK-SNARKs be audited 
    and tested for security vulnerabilities.

    The `ZKSnark` class is designed as a conceptual placeholder for implementing Zero-Knowledge SNARKs 
    in a blockchain context. This class outlines how proofs might be generated and verified, but 
    the actual cryptographic security of SNARKs is not implemented in this version.
    
    In a fully implemented version, ZK-SNARKs enable privacy-preserving transactions by allowing 
    validators to confirm that a transaction is valid without knowing the specific details.

        often in a trusted setup phase. These keys are used for securely generating and verifying 
        zero-knowledge proofs. This step is skipped in this mock version.

"""
Security and Cryptographic Considerations:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**:
   ZK-SNARKs are a highly advanced cryptographic tool used in blockchain systems to enhance privacy 
   and scalability. While this module provides a placeholder for proof generation and verification, 
   real implementations require sophisticated cryptographic algorithms, including trusted setup and 
   elliptic curve cryptography.

2. **Hashing Mechanism**:
   Although this demonstration uses SHA-256 for hashing data, a real ZK-SNARK implementation would involve 
   more complex cryptographic operations. However, hashing is critical for ensuring data integrity 
   in any cryptographic proof system. In a production environment, the hashing function should be 
   integrated into the proof generation process securely.

3. **Future Expansion**:
   This module is designed to serve as a framework for further development. Once the actual ZK-SNARK 
   cryptography is integrated, this class will allow the generation of privacy-preserving proofs for 
   blockchain data, ensuring that sensitive information remains hidden while still verifiable.
